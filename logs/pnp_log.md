#### Meeting Summary
- Podcast group: Deciding podcast strucutre, considering looking at synth bio from the perspective of different disciplines. Inviting team members from wet lab, dry lab, RnD, and doctors to provide their insight into it

- Summer camp: Want to have activities over the course of a few days that are based on each group (dry lab, wet lab, etc). Possible activities: CRISPR 101 crash course with a wet lab member, coding with R/Python with dry lab, panel with high school students moderated by pnp members, talking about synth bio and high school
  
- Iconathon: Pairing artists with scientists to design an icon related to synthbio

#### TODO
- Booking room space, writing script for first podcast episode

### Week 3: June 5 - June 11

#### Meeting Outline

#### Meeting Summary
- Podcast group: Possibility of asking team members or general public about things related to synth bio, would also act as a form of       marketing

- Summer camp: Finding biosafety certified room for wet lab related activity
  
- Iconathon: Plans to make it happen in mid-July

- General project: Don't want to do something related to designer babies, hHaving a video component on the wiki page with short snapchat style videos 

#### TODO

### Week 4: June 12 - June 18

#### Meeting Outline

#### Meeting Summary
- Podcast: Second episode will be about the ethics of synth bio, want to interview professors and grad students about it

- Summer camp: Need to book room to find out what sort of activites can be done in it

- Iconathon: No updates

- General project: Going to be a series of video interviews with various types of people (professionals, general public, parents, religious groups, religious scientists, people who would be affected by the anti CRISPR like those with disabilities) to get a firsthand account of the sociological impacts of the wet lab project. These interviews would be more local just to make the project more focused and it most likely won't include the integrated human practices. 
   
#### TODO
- Come up with case study/ies, summer camp poster design and marketing, reaching out to possible interviewees

### Week 5: June 19 - June 25

#### Meeting Outline

#### Meeting Summary
- Podcast: First episode is done and uploaded onto the podcast channel on slack (listen to it it's p good). Waiting for responses from interviewees so they can continue writing the second episode script

- Summer camp: Thinking of having it in September before school starts again (Labour day week). Might go to past to high schools and reaching out to science teachers to possibly pass out flyers, maybe email the TDSB.Reaching out to dry lab, wet lab members who can code to help out on the first day

- Iconathon: Pushed back to end of July

- General project: Entirely video based. Might have one long documentary like video of all the interviews done and split up each video into individual interviews so people can learn more about a specifc interview. Website would be an angled aerial view of a community of people who represent the interviewees (person beside uoft building a professor, family) with their corresponding video beside them
Possible subjects: Politicans and legislators, members of religous communities, professors, parents, medical professionals, students, adovcacy groups

#### TODO
- Add to list of possible interview contacts, start recording second podcast episode
- Start podcast website, repo for podcast items, podcast logo and possible names (synth talks is the current working one)
