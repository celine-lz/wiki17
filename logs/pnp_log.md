### Week 4: June 12 - June 18

#### Meeting Outline

#### Meeting Summary
- Podcast: Second episode will be about the ethics of synth bio, want to interview professors and grad students about it

- Summer camp: Need to book room to find out what sort of activites can be done in it

- Iconathon: No updates

- General project: Going to be a series of video interviews with various types of people (professionals, general public, parents,      
  religious groups, religious scientists, people who would be affected by the anti CRISPR like those with disabilities) to get a 
  firsthand account of the sociological impacts of the wet lab project. These interviews would be more local just to make the project
  more focused and it most likely won't include the integrated human practices. 
   
#### TODO
- Come up with case study/ies, summer camp poster design and marketing, reaching out to possible interviewees
