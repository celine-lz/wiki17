### Project Description
The wet lab study a LacILOV/cI repressor circuit for the purpose of controlling CRISPR gene editing. The LacILOV repressor is a light-activated fusion protein which represses downstream transcription of sgRNA necessary for CRISPR-Cas9 targeting and the cI repressor in the dark, but allows transcription in blue light. The cI repressor prevents transcription of the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4spy, thus forming a complementary "OFF" command for the LacILOV-controlled sgRNA "ON" switch. The switch will be validated in *E. coli* cells in a circuit, using the response YFP and mCherry to measure its kinetics via fluorescence and qPCR assays. Finally, CRISPR activity will be tested by targeting the *araC* gene with CRISPRi for silencing, and measuring the resulting population levels in an arabinose environment.

  * Bronze
  * Silver
  * Gold
* Talk about our goals

#### Meeting Summary

##### Medal requirements

###### Bronze requirements

Characterization/Contribution: We will participate in the Interlab Measurement Study to fulfill this requirement
* have to characterize a standard part set (usually they emit GFP)
  * collect fluorescence data form plate reader
  * see how standardized the readings are
  * increase significance of results by combining with iGEM teams around the world
* This will be done in the DH5alpha strain
* goal: start this week (as soon as we acquire the strain)
  * Ideally we will make it chemically competent and transform by Friday
  * 3-4 day protocol

###### Silver requirements

Validated part/contribution: prove we can get something to work (one of our constructs)
* members: review constructs to make sure the purpose is understood for all of them

Collaboration
* oGEM is a way for us to set up collaborations (but not in and of itself a collab)
* we shoudl also look through the rest of the projects for this year for any similar ones we can work together on

###### Gold requirements

Improve a previous part/project: We are submitting LacILOV as an improvement on LacI

Demonstrate: Showing that our switch works
* this is what the assays are for

###### Our goals
* went over goals for leads, managers, and general members
* key point: never be afraid to ask questions

##### Updates

Over the past week, the leads have:
* set up the lab
  * ***always put things back where you got them!***
* Done inventory and acquired reagents
* gotten trained on equipment
* Written, changed, and learned protocols
* made competent cell stocks
  * note: everyone will get to do this as it will have to be done a lot
* Designed and ordered inserts, added UNS to backbone to help Gibson cloning/assembly
* Tried PCR and found out we need new dNTPs
* Met with Dr. Maxwell, an anti-CRISPR biochemist
  * We'll be able to ask her for help regarding troubleshooting and our assays later on

###### Transformation

The DH10beta strain is good for cloning/mass producing plasmids
* It was made chemically competent with RbCl
* Used an RFP plasmid kit to test efficiency by inserting RFP at different concentrations on LB+CAM plates (100, 50, 10, and 0)
  * Also tested compared to last year's cells
* As expected, this year's cells are more competent and had no growth on controls

###### Nanodrop

Nanodrop measures the concentration of DNA in a sample and gives possible sources of contamination
* Uses absorbance to estimate protein and organic contamination and DNA concentration
* n.b. can have a lot of confounding factors so make sure to look carefully at results
* In the future, save all nanodrop results to lab USB

###### PCR

This week's PCR didn't give the expected results for two likely reasons
* because our dNTPs were expired
  * over time, phosphate groups degrade and dNTP stops working
* protocol was optimized for long gels, but a short one was done
  * can see the ladder at 1kb so it probably didn't run OFF

#### TODO

This week:
* Make plates
* Run gel for Friday's RE digested miniprep
* Tuesday: Q5 PCR tutorial with Christian
  * Buy dNTPs and plates from Medstore
  * Autoclave pyrex bottles
* Wed-Thurs: Overhang PCR to amplify UNSs into backbones
* Thurs-Fri: Start Interlab study
  * Make competent DH5 stock (start 5mL Tuesday overnight)
* Miniprep transformed MG1655deltaLacI
* general members: review protocols for chemically competent cells, competency testing, nanodrop

Over the summer:
* Design and order sgRNAs for dCas9/antiCRISPR system
* Assemble the switch with Gibson
* Characterize switch from fluorescence assay results
* Transform switch into electrocompetent MG1655-dCas9
* Confirm dCas9/antiCRISPR functionality with AraC and phage assays

  * pKDL071
  * pSB1C3
  * Interlab
* Plan for week 3
  * assembly
* Iconathon
* iGEM Calgary newsletter

#### Meeting Summary

##### Weekly summary

###### pKDL071 plasmid
* Monday
  * Transformed into competent DH10b
  * Plated on LB kan to seect transformed
* Tuesday:
  * checked plates
  * Observed colonies-> cells were transformed
  * colony inoculated overnight in 5 mL kan overnight for next day miniprep
* Wednesday
  * miniprepped to extract plasmid
  * PCRed miniprepped plasmid
  * temperature gradient - sample 3 brightest band at 68C
  * plan to make bacterial stocks with plsamid
* Thursday
  * ran another PCR at 68C to get more product
  * this gets us more plasmid to do assembly
  * bands were fainter than Wednesday's
  * Got new primers to did another gradient PCR
  * all looked good
* Friday
  * dpn1 digest
  * PCR purification - goal was to assemble
  * opened tubes to allow ethanol to evaporate (in fume hood for ~2 hours)
* Monday (today)
  * Ran PCR again and got favourable results

###### pSB1C3 backbone
This backbone is required for iGEM submission - we need both this and pKDL since our CRISPR assays require 2 plasmids with different antibiotics in to select for successful transformed
* Monday
  * transformed DH5a with different concentrations of pSB1C3_RFP to test competence
    * DH5a and DH10b are both e. coli strains that are good for cloning
    * the DH5a cells were made competetent last Friday
      * they are required specifically for the Interlab study (not DH10b)
  * counted red colonies (indicates RFP is present) to see how competent the cells are
* Tuesday
  * cells grew on selective plates -> they are competent
* Wednesday
  * Miniprepped to have more pSB1C3
  * Redid CR at higher T gradient - worked better compared to overlapping T from last PCR
    * didn't have to let ethanol evaporate out of wells for DNA
* Thursday
  * new primers arrived

###### Interlab
* Monday
  * Transformed DH5a from Friday with pSB1C3_RFP to test competence
* Tuesday
  * cells grew on selective media (LB cam) -> competent
  * transformed with interlab plasmids from iGEM kit
* Wednesday
  * cells grew on selective media -> transformation successful
    * calculations were off - too much CAM so not enough colonies
    * still needed more colonies
  * replated cells from Tuesday transformation
* Thursday
  * Got (very few) colonies but need more
started overnight 5 mL LB cam culture
* Friday
  * plated 100 uL cells on new LB CAM plates
    * didn't get large colonies but a lot of cells spread around the plates
    * used beads to do spread plating - with streak plating we would have observed different concentrations, so you'd get single colonies in one or two quadrants
        * spread plating is good if you know your cells are less concentrated

##### Iconathon
Discussed Iconathon (happening this Saturday) and brainstormed possible categories/subjects

#### TODO
Done last week:
* make LB+CAM plates
* Streak interlab cells
* run gel on PCR purified pKLD071 - re-PCR, digest, and purify if gel shows nothing

Today
* pSB1C3 Dpn1 digest, PCR purification
* gel running now

Tomorrow:
* Assemble reporter constructs into pSB1C3 and pKDL071

Later this week:
* glycerol stocks of cells with assembled plasmids
* miniprep transformed cells
* transform MG1655 ΔLacI (and DH5a to confirm if there's a problem it's is in the assembly process and not transformation)
* characterize reporter construct

    * Assembly
        * pKDL071
        * pSB1C3
    * Interlab
* To-dos

#### Meeting Summary

##### Weekly Summary

###### Assembly

####### pKDL071
Assembled reporter and mCherry construct to make sure LacILOV is working - ideally we should see mCherry in the dark
* Monday: Ran a gel of pKDL071 digestion/PCR purification from Friday
    * Gel: was successful so continued with assembly
* Tuesday: Assembled reporter insert and LacILOV-mCherry insert
* Wednesday: Observed colonies for both, so started 5 mL overnight cultures for miniprep
* Thursday: miniprepped both plasmids to isolate them
    * Streaked cells from 5 mL cultures onto plates
    * tried to restreak to get more colonies

####### pSB1C3
* Monday: did Dpn1 digest and PCR purification
    * Didn't observe any product - possibly lost during purification process
    * nanodrop concentrations were low (<10 ng)
* Wednesday: attempted another PCR at 86C (the midrange of last week's gradient)
* Thursday: Ran a gel on the PCR product which showed that it didn't work
    * Redid PCR at 72C
* Friday: Ran another gel but it was imaged at low exposure (~20 ms), so might have had product but couldn't see it
* Monday: Ran another PCR but got primer dimers

###### Interlab
* Tuesday: restreaked cells from overgrown plates to get single colonies
* Wednesday: inoculated 5 mL cultures with single colonies
* Thursday: Made glycerol stocks from 5 mL cultures
* Friday: LUDOX-S40 and H2O readings (first step of Interlab protocol)

#### TODO
Monday
* Measure GFP (using GFP settings for fluorescence)
    * Don't know the optimal settings because nobody in Biozone uses GFP
    * Plating them in different wells for plate reader - will test different wavelengths to find the best one for excitation

This week:
* Assembly of reporter plasmid and mCherry construct in pSB1C3
* Finish Interlab study measurements
* Colony PCR assemblies in pKDL071
* Make more competent cells MG1655 delta LacI
