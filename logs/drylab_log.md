### Week 4: June 12 - June 18

#### Meeting Outline

#### Meeting Summary

•	Develop model to measure dynamics
•	Implement model in matlab library creating a flow chart, using rate kinetics given by the wet lab
•	Figure out how the model works before moving on
•	Optimize the model using degradation, intensity of light, etc
     o	Researching s-avenues 
     o	Will be done in September 
•	Type of model we’re using ->
     o	Not Boolean = only an on and off representation
     o	Not continuous = allows for a gradient of proteins; deterministic = no probability
     o	Not coupled differential equation -> considered for ease of progress
     o	Stochastic = relies on random variables, represents each of the reactions as a probability distribution
•	mRNA is Poisson distribution while gene activation is like coin flip 
•	trying to find a compromise of a stochastic model 
•	Bioinformatics Learning Tool = Developing an app that allows people to better understand the messy and complex field of bioinformatics 


#### TODO

	Algorithm to optimize the stochastic model – trial and error process
  Model building tutorial from Christian soon!
