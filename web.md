## Pages and General Content Outline
- Home (navbar): Creative intro, textual intro, project timeline, past projects, sponsors, links to other pages
- Teams (navbar):  Description of all three teams [we dont count :(], members list
- Podcast (navbar): podcast logo, episode list
- Contact (navbar): Contacts for interested members, Contacts for sponsorship
- Past Project (optional): A bigger description to each project, all associated links.

## General Design

#### Colors

Go with color scheme B or C from Tracy's plattes.

#### Subtle Background Patterns

- Subtle background patterns related to cell biology (Look at link 1 and 2 for similar example) There can be multiple different icons or just one. 
- Make the pattern icons grey or black and very low in opacity, so that the patterns can be used on any background color. 
- (Optional) Also it might be nice to have different themed patterns (wet lab, dry lab, pnp theme).

#### Typeface

- Lato on the logo looks great. Let's mix it up in the content with a serif. A slab-serif might look quite nice and give a techy vibe to associate with synthetic biology.

#### Artstyle

- I will let you go with your own style. There are too many ways to go about it and make it look good. 
- maybe really flat? maybe flat design with outlines? maybe even low poly design (never seen a website like that)

Small things to consider
- Small animations within the graphics (similar to link 3 and 4)
- Initial animation for the graphics (similar to link 2)
- Tracy's example from meeting

## Page Specific Design

#### Home Page

Intro Div
- It could be anything. Few cool designs:
	-	Similar to the current one
		- http://bioartlab.com
		- http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/
		- http://rileyjshaw.com/terra/
	- Simple Text based
		- https://www.deskpass.com/bridge-content?ref=landingfolio&discount=true
		- https://git.market or http://www.stephanemartinw.com (look at the text writing itself. Maybe it can be used in teams page too) 
	- Biocircuits
		- https://dribbble.com/shots/2383303-College-of-Management-School-of-Design-Spring-program-2015 (animate the nodes in the circuit and changes the nodes into biological elemnts)

- Project timeline
	- A donut chart. Make it look like a plasmid and every "gene" will represent different time period of the project.
	- Hovering over a "gene" will pop up a description of the part of the project
	- "Genes": Jamboree, Research, Summer project

- Past Projects
	- DNA in the middle as the bar of the timeline
	- Base pairs from the DNA exapnds to each project

- Sponsors
	- A div with the logos of all our sponsors (find from past wiki)

#### Team page
- Div 1: 3 characters -> dry lab, wet lab, pnp
	- Each cartoon will represent each team
	- wet lab -> lab coat, glasses, test tubes in hand (look at Tracy's drawing)
	- dry lab -> Computer nerd, maybe laptop and starbucks in hand
	- pnp -> suits
	- Clicking on a character will scroll down to their respective divs

- Div 2: wet lab
	- Wet lab character animates down
	- Animate in a lab bench and lab equipments
	- Dark bc
	- Fluroescence theme
	- Things to put on the lab bench example: https://dribbble.com/shots/1759024-Science
	- Get some petri dishes too

- Div 3: dry lab
	- Computer nerd
	- Desk + computers. example: https://dribbble.com/shots/2946166-Programmer-Working-Place
	- Lighter bc to contrast wet lab

- Div 4: PnP
	- dunno lol
	- advertise the podcast?

- Div 5: Members
	- scrollable divs
	- members from all past teams

- Content organization: (link 2) 
	- 2 column style
	- Alternate the content and graphics side every div
	- Maybe you can have the secondary elements part of the background (similar to link 6)

- Changing background: two different ways to do it.
	- Smooth transition of bc color: 
	- Divs have different bc color (look at link 6)
